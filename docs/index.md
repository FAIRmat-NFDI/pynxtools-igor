# Documentation for pynxtools-igor

pynxtools-igor is a free, and open-source data software for converting data stored with Wavemetrics [Igor Pro](https://www.wavemetrics.com/) into the [NeXus](https://www.nexusformat.org/) format. It is implemented as a plugin for [pynxtools](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/pynxtools) and allows to read, translate, and standardize data from Igor Pro binary waves and packed experiment files. Depending on the domain of data, pynxtools allows to ensure compliance with various NeXus application definitions, e.g. [NXmpes](https://fairmat-nfdi.github.io/nexus_definitions/classes/contributed_definitions/NXmpes.html) for for angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments, or [NXxrd](https://fairmat-nfdi.github.io/nexus_definitions/classes/contributed_definitions/NXxrd.html) for x-ray diffraction experiments.

pynxtools-igor is developed both as a standalone reader and as a tool within [NOMAD](https://nomad-lab.eu/), which is the open-source data management platform for materials science we are developing within [FAIRmat](https://www.fairmat-nfdi.eu/fairmat/).
